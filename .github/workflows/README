OTP mentor needs a separate EC2 instance to recalculate graph data.
This instance is usually dormant and only activated on demand when data changes.

So on repo push, the docker image is created regularily and pushed to the repo,
but not deployed yet (as the instance doesn't exist).

Once a graph recalculation is needed, a separate github action spins up the
instance,deploys/runs the image, then spins it down again.
This is either triggered manually or via REST api.
